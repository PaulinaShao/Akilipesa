# Guest Mode + Open Feed First Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a TikTok-style "open feed first" experience with Guest Mode and fair-use trial limits. Users now see the Tanzanite splash screen followed by the home feed (reels) before being prompted to sign in.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Entry Flow
- **Splash Screen**: 3-second Tanzanite logo animation with sparkles
- **Open Feed**: Direct access to `/reels` feed without authentication
- **Session Memory**: Splash only shows once per session using sessionStorage

### 2. Guest Mode Access
**Allowed for Guests:**
- Browse reels feed and view content
- Open product detail pages (`/product/:id`)
- View profiles and captions
- Share content (no auth required)
- Shop products (direct access)

**Blocked (Shows Guest Gate):**
- Like, comment, follow actions
- Messaging and calls
- Content creation
- Wallet access
- Profile editing

### 3. Guest Gate Modal
- **Title**: "Unlock more with AkiliPesa"
- **Benefits**: Earnings, selling, calls, withdrawals, premium tools
- **Options**: Phone login (primary), Google login (secondary), "Maybe later"
- **Smart Routing**: Redirects to `/auth/login` with context

### 4. Trial System
**Device-Local Quotas:**
- 1 free call per day (if admin enabled)
- 2 AI trials per day (resets at midnight)
- 10-minute cooldown after call attempts
- Persistent device fingerprinting

**Anti-Abuse Controls:**
- Server-side quota validation
- Device token tracking in Firestore
- Rate limiting for trial API calls
- Offline-first with Firebase fallbacks

### 5. UI Components

**Splash Component** (`/components/Splash.tsx`):
- Animated Tanzanite logo with enhanced glow effects
- Configurable duration (default 2.8s)
- Automatic navigation to feed

**WalletChip Component** (`/components/WalletChip.tsx`):
- Shows only on first reel
- Guest variant: "Tap to start earning"
- User variant: Shows actual balance
- Hides on scroll (after 60px)
- Smooth backdrop blur styling

**GuestGate Modal** (`/components/GuestGate.tsx`):
- Clean modal with benefit bullets
- Consistent button styling
- Proper z-index layering
- Accessible dismissal

### 6. Technical Architecture

**Guest Authentication** (`/lib/guest.ts`):
- Anonymous Firebase auth for read-only access
- Graceful fallback for offline scenarios
- Preserves existing authenticated sessions

**Action Guards** (`/lib/guards.ts`):
- `isGuest()`: Detects anonymous users
- `requireAuthOrGate()`: Controls access flow
- Clean separation of guest vs authenticated logic

**Entry Control** (`/lib/entry.ts`):
- Session-based splash display logic
- One-time experience per session

**Trial State Management** (`/state/guestTrialStore.ts`):
- localStorage-based quota tracking
- Daily reset mechanism
- Device ID generation and persistence

### 7. Server-Side Protection

**Rate Limiting** (`firebase/functions/src/rateLimiter.ts`):
- Firestore-based quota tracking
- Daily limits: 1 call, 2 AI interactions
- Hard server-side validation

**Enhanced Trial Functions**:
- Added device quota checks to `requestGuestCall`
- Added quota validation to `guestChat`
- Prevents client-side bypass attempts

### 8. Navigation & Routing

**Updated App.tsx**:
- Splash-first entry flow
- Guest-accessible routes
- Public product pages
- Seamless auth integration

**Updated ReelsPage**:
- Guest Gate integration
- WalletChip on first reel
- Guest-aware interaction patterns
- Removed dependency on old auth gates

### 9. Styling & UX

**Button Utilities** (`/styles/util.css`):
- `.btn-primary`: Tanzanite gradient buttons
- `.btn-secondary`: Glass morphism secondary
- `.btn-ghost`: Minimal ghost buttons
- Consistent hover and active states

**Visual Design**:
- Maintains existing Tanzanite color scheme
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Mobile-optimized touch targets
- Accessible focus states

## Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_FREE_CALLS_ENABLED=true    # Enable guest calls
VITE_GUEST_MODE=true           # Enable guest mode (default)
```
