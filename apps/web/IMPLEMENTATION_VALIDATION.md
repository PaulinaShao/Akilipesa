## 🔧 **Key Features Validation**

### **Phone Input Behaviors:**
```typescript
// ✅ All formats normalize correctly:
normalizeTZ("0713123456")  → {e164: "+255713123456", local: "713123456"}
normalizeTZ("713123456")   → {e164: "+255713123456", local: "713123456"}  
normalizeTZ("+255713123456") → {e164: "+255713123456", local: "713123456"}
normalizeTZ("255713123456")  → {e164: "+255713123456", local: "713123456"}
```

### **CodeInput Features:**
- [x] Auto-advance between 4-6 boxes
- [x] Paste support fills all boxes
- [x] Backspace navigation
- [x] "Enter the 6-digit code sent via SMS or WhatsApp"
- [x] Resend countdown timer

### **Auth Flow Copy:**
- [x] Title: "Sign in to AkiliPesa"
- [x] Subtitle: "Save your likes, follow creators, buy & earn rewards."
- [x] Buttons: "Send code", "Verify & continue"
- [x] Divider: "or"
- [x] Footer: "Terms • Privacy • Help"

### **Splash Logic:**
```typescript
// ✅ localStorage management:
localStorage['ap.splashSeen'] === '1' → skip to /reels
localStorage['ap.splashSeen'] === null → show 1.2s animation → set flag → /reels
```

---

## 🔐 **Firebase & Security Integration**

### **Preserved Components:**
- [x] Firebase Phone Auth integration ready
- [x] reCAPTCHA Enterprise compatibility maintained  
- [x] Google OAuth provider unchanged
- [x] Existing auth state management preserved
- [x] Current routes/navigation intact

### **Auth Gating Implementation:**
```typescript
// ✅ Guest action interception:
const gatedLike = useGatedLike();
const handleLike = () => gatedLike(() => {
  // Actual like logic executed after auth
});
```

## 📊 **Quality Assurance**

### **Build Status:** ✅ PASSING
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- Bundle generation: ✅ Successful
- Asset optimization: ✅ Complete

### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Phone field never overlaps (TZ +255 prefix is separate span)
- [x] 0713…, 713…, +255713…, 255713… normalize to +255713... 
- [x] OTP paste works, auto-advance, resend timer
- [x] Guest actions trigger AuthSheet → auth success → action resumes
- [x] Splash plays once per session (`ap.splashSeen=1`)
- [x] Dark mode contrast AA+

### **Browser Compatibility:**
- [x] Mobile keyboard support (`inputMode="numeric"`)
- [x] Touch-friendly targets (44px+)
- [x] Gesture support (swipe to dismiss sheet)
- [x] Performance optimizations (GPU transforms)
